## My process

For this project I used a basic container div to hold the contents of the qr code and text. This allowed me to position it where it needed to go. Inside that I used another div to contain the QR code image, that way I could control the size of that box easily.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that putting an image inside of a div will allow you a little more control.

### Continued development

My continued learning will be to maintain focus and keep pressing on. I have been dabbling with front end for a bit, but need to continue to stay on track.
